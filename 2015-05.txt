===========================================================
 West Yorkshire Python User Group Meeting - Thurs. 14th May
===========================================================

This month we plan to hack on the WYPy web site to make it more attractive and
informative.

The Plan
========

* Make the site more appealing to look at - new design, pictures, etc.
* Display current, next, and past events.
* Anything else we think might be useful.

Who's it for?
=============

Anyone is welcome. We need people with design skills just as much as we need
Python skills.

Date and Time
=============

Thursday 14th May.  Starting at 7.30pm.

If you want to arrive before the talk, the venue will be open from
about 7.00pm.  We will finish at around 8.30pm-9.00pm, and will be going to the
White Swan pub afterwards.

Location
========

We will be meeting at the offices of The Test People:

| Floor 4
| Albion Court
| Albion Place
| Leeds
| West Yorkshire,
| LS1 6JL

There will be a note on the door with a number to call and buzz you in.

About the Group
===============

The West Yorkshire Python User Group (WYPy) have been meeting monthly since
2007. Our meetings are free, and usually include at least one talk, as well as
a trip to the pub.

Our website is at http://wypy.org.uk/. We discuss our meetings on the Python
Yorkshire and Humberside Google Group

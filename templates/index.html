<h1 class="title">West Yorkshire Python User Group Meeting - Thurs. 14th August</h1>

<p>This week we have a talk from Peter Russell.</p>
<div class="section" id="simple-selenium-test-a-case-study">
<h1>Simple Selenium Test - A case study</h1>
<p>Simple Selenium Test (SST, <a class="reference external" href="http://testutils.org/sst/">http://testutils.org/sst/</a> ) is an open source Python
framework for writing automated tests for web applications.  SST tests use
Selenium Webdriver to drive real web browsers around the system under test.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The Test People recently used SST for the first time in a large project for a client.  In this talk I'll cover:</li>
<li>How SST compares with other approaches to writing automated functional tests for webapps.</li>
<li>Why we thought SST was an appropriate choice for this project</li>
<li>What changes we needed to make to the framework to support our needs</li>
<li>What changes I'd like to see in the future</li>
<li>Whether SST lived up to its promise</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Peter Russell is a Senior Consultant working at The Test People.</p>

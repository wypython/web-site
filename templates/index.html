<h1 class="title">West Yorkshire Python User Group Meeting - Thurs. 15th Jan</h1>

<p>This week we have a talk from Tony Simpson</p>
<div class="section" id="micropython">
<h1>Micropython</h1>
<p>In the first of three meetups focused on Python for micro controller
programming Tony will introduce us to the Micropython board, how to get started
programming the board, key differences between Micropython and cPython and
throw out some ideas for projects based on Micropython.</p>
<p>Micropython is a great entry point to low level programming for Python
programmers.  Micropython has similar hardware to Arduino but is more
accessable due to being focused on Python.</p>
<p>Tony is an experienced Python hacker who loves new and interesting problems</p>

===============================================================
 West Yorkshire Python User Group Meeting - Thurs. ?? February
===============================================================

----------------------------------------------------
 Invited Talk: Alex Valavanis - Inkscape and Python
----------------------------------------------------

This month we have another exciting guest speaker! Alex Valavanis is a
member of the development team of Inkscape; a popular open source
vector graphics editor.

Alex will be telling us about how he became involved with Inkscape,
what he does on the project, giving an architectural overview of the
software, and throwing in some Python interest by talking about
writing extensions.

We expect the talk to be of interest to all programmers of all skill
levels.  It won't be particularly Python-heavy.

Thursday ?? February, talk from 7:30pm.

If you want to arrive before the talk, the venue will be open from

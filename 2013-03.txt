============================================================
 West Yorkshire Python User Group Meeting - Thurs. 14 March
============================================================

-----------------------------------------------
 Coding Session - Porting Restish to Python 3
-----------------------------------------------

This month we have decided to do some good for the world, by porting
Matt Goodall's web framework Restish to Python 3.  Matt is a member of
the group, so we'll have all the context we could hope for.

You can find the source for Restish here[1] and the early work on
porting it to Python 3 here[2].

Don't worry if you're new to Python 3 (a lot of us are), or even to
Python, we'll muddle through and figure it out!

You should probably bring a laptop with Python 2.6 or higher and Python 3.3
installed if you have one available.

==========================================================
 West Yorkshire Python User Group Meeting - Thurs. 14 June
==========================================================

-------------------------------
 Talk: Comparing Go and Python
-------------------------------

Go is a new language with a long pedigree. It was designed at Google
by Rob Pike (one of the designers of Unix) and Ken Thomson (one of the
designers of C).  Go seems to be gaining traction as an environment
for developing simple, efficient applications.

Matt Goodall (@atomatt) will be introducing us to Go; showing us some
of the key aspects of the language and the runtime's concurrency
primitives by building a simple server application.

Throughout we will be comparing Go with Python, looking at where it
would be a better fit, and where Python wins.

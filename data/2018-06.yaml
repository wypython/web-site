    About the meeting
    =================

    This month we're meeting at Sky's offices in Leeds Dock. Doors will open at 6:30. You will
    need to sign-in at Sky 2 before going to the meeting in Sky 1 but don't worry we'll make 
    sure there are signs.
    
    We have a fantastic talk from Simon Davy on a topic that should lead to some interesting
    discussion. The talk will start at 7:30. Talks and questions are normally over by 8:30. 
    After the talk and questions we'll move to a local pub such as The Lamb and Flag for more 
    discussion and socialising.


    Talks: Changing and Documenting Online APIs in a world of Continuous Deployments - Simon Davy
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Making changes to a Web API is hard work. You have to be careful not to introduce backwards
    incompatible changes. Any changes you do make need versioning and documenting somehow. And
    when your service is deployed multiple times a day, it's easy for developers to accidentally
    introduce changes or not document them properly.

    My team has recently been developing a process that aim to make it easier for developers
    to make changes safely as possible. It also provides accurate documentation that is tightly
    coupled to the implementation in the code.

    I will present an overview of the process, and demonstrate the tooling we've developed to
    support it for Python web applications. While the tool itself is probably too specific to our
    needs for general use, I'm interesting in gathering input on the ideas and goals we've
    experimented with.

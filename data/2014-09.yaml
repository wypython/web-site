title: "Encouraging Contributions To Your Open Source Project"
date: 2013-09-12
body: |
    The way you treat first-time contributions to your open source project is very important if you wish to receive more.
    Not only will a bad experience put the submitter off, but the open nature of the project means that potential future submitters may see the response and decide to put their time in elsewhere.

    Learn some of the things that you can do after putting your code on github to encourage contributions, from documentation to review, and how to help a submitter bring a patch up to your standards.

    James is long-time open source contributer who works in Online Services for Canonical.

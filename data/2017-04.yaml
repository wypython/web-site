title: Python/Django Workshop
date: 2017-04-13
body: |

    James Wilson has kindly volunteered to give an overview of a Django app
    he's been working on recently:

      A web app to manage case notes and tasks for a number of NUT officers,
      some of whom are "not good with computers." Needs to:

      - Be simple and easy to use
      - Let certain users see and edit other people's cases

    We'll then use James' app as the basis for a Python/Django workshop.

    For anyone wanting to do some homework, the project's source code is hosted
    on github: https://github.com/wilsonrocks/caseworkclub.


    Date and Time

    We will finish at about 9:00pm, and will be going to `The White Swan`_ pub
    afterwards.

    From the Futurelabs web site: "If you’re walking, we’re 50 yards from the
    back entrance of the Victoria Quarter. Simply look left, walk to the
    crossroads and we’re in the building on the opposite corner (above the Gas
    Showrooms). Take the door to the left of the Gas Showrooms and our
    Reception is on the second floor."

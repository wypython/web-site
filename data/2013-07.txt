 West Yorkshire Python User Group Meeting - Thurs. 11 July

------------------------------------------
 Coding Session: Turtles All The Way Down
------------------------------------------

This month Simon Davy is going to be leading a coding session.

About the session
=================
Since PyCon UK last year, Simon has been exploring the idea of doing more with
Python's turtle module, specifically using it for more fun, engaging and
progressively more advanced ways of teaching children.

Simon will do a short (20min max) overview of what he's been doing
(OpenGL renderer, standalone implementation, enhanced existing
version), and what he's planning (physics), and then talk about some
of the lesson/task ideas.

We'll then split into pairs and attempt to program a few of these ideas in
one hour, and then get back together to see what we've got. The goals are a) to
try it out as an exercise, b) have some examples to show, c) find friction
points and discover what things would need to be provided for novice
programmers to be successful.

I hope that we'll end up committing some bare bones examples to the
Github organisation (and also participate in Julython).

Who's it for?
=============
This session should be suitable for all.  People who are just getting
started with Python might particularly like it, as you'll have the
chance program with an experienced Python user.

Date and Time
=============

Thursday 11 July.  Talk at 7.30.

If you want to arrive before the talk, The venue will be open from
about 6.30.  We will be finished at around 9, and we will be going to

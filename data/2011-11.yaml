    About the meeting
    =================

    We'll be arriving at Old Broadcasting House from about 6:30 onwards for vaguely Python related chat.
    At 7:30 there will be a talk, which is expected to last for about an half an hour.
    After that we will head to a pub for more geeky chat.

    The meetings are always good fun, and everyone of any level of experience or interest in Python is extremely welcome.
    Bring a friend!

    Talk: "Testing in Python" - Peter Russell
    -----------------------------------------

    This talk was postponed last month due to lack of time.

    Automated testing is now an important discipline in software development.
    In this talk Peter will be presenting some of his views on how to test code written in Python, the virtues (or otherwise) of test driven development as a methodology, and some of the tools available for testing.

    Experience Level:
        A basic level of Python knowledge would be helpful.

    Of Interest to:
        This talk will not be a "how to test" tutorial, rather a personal perspective on testing.
        As such it should be of interest to people who are experienced in unit, functional and integration testing as well as people who are new to automated testing.

    Date and Time

    Thursday 10 November, from 6:30pm.
    Talk at 7:30.

title: "Suggestions on designing a flexible framework"
date: 2014-06-12
speaker: Maik Hoepfel
body: |
    Oscar is a Django e-commerce framework designed for flexibility.
    It employs a range of techniques that allow to swap out every aspect of it.
    In this way it can be used to capture a wide range of e-commerce requirements, but the framework code still stays sane.

    This talk will examine the key techniques used by Oscar that allow this flexibility, and offer some insights on how to approach the design of frameworks in different domains.

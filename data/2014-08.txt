==============================================================
 West Yorkshire Python User Group Meeting - Thurs. 14th August
==============================================================


This week we have a talk from Peter Russell.


Simple Selenium Test - A case study
====================================

Simple Selenium Test (SST, http://testutils.org/sst/ ) is an open source Python
framework for writing automated tests for web applications.  SST tests use
Selenium Webdriver to drive real web browsers around the system under test.

 * The Test People recently used SST for the first time in a large project for a client.  In this talk I'll cover:
 * How SST compares with other approaches to writing automated functional tests for webapps.
 * Why we thought SST was an appropriate choice for this project
 * What changes we needed to make to the framework to support our needs
 * What changes I'd like to see in the future
 * Whether SST lived up to its promise


Peter Russell is a Senior Consultant working at The Test People.

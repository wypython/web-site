    We have no talk this month, so we're going to spend the evening reviewing some of the talks at PyCon, and chatting about the news in the Python world.
    We'll probably try to watch one of the talks.

    The venue will be open from about 6.30.
    We will be finished by 9, and we will be going to the pub afterwards.

    This month we plan to hack on the WYPy web site to make it more attractive and
    informative.

    The Plan
    ========

    * Make the site more appealing to look at - new design, pictures, etc.
    * Display current, next, and past events.
    * Anything else we think might be useful.

    Who's it for?
    =============

    Anyone is welcome.
    We need people with design skills just as much as we need Python skills.

    Date and Time
    =============

    Thursday 14th May.  Starting at 7.30pm.

    If you want to arrive before the talk, the venue will be open from about 7.00pm.
    We will finish at around 8.30pm-9.00pm, and will be going to `The White Swan`_ pub afterwards.

    Location
    ========

    We will be meeting at the offices of `The Test People`_:

    | Floor 4
    | Albion Court
    | Albion Place
    | Leeds
    | West Yorkshire,
    | LS1 6JL

    There will be a note on the door with a number to call and buzz you in.

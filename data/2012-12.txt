 West Yorkshire Python User Group Meeting - Thurs. 13 December
===============================================================

---------------------------------------
 Talk: Simon Davy, Unit testing Django
---------------------------------------

Django includes a test framework that is very convenient and widely
used. It includes test database set up, fixtures, and a convenient way
of calling your via Django's framework.

However, it is actually testing your application at integration level,
rather than at *unit* level. Integration tests are good, but so are
unit tests! (which test smaller areas and run faster).

In this talk we'll look at three different ways to use standard unit
testing techniques when testing django applications to write actual
unit tests.

title: Becoming Polyglot - Lorna Mitchell
date: 2017-03-02
body: |
    To be polyglot is to be a metaphorical global citizen of the software
    world; to accrue and know how to apply skills beyond the technologies you
    use in your day-to-day activities.  When we're already expert in the
    technology stack we're mostly paid to work on, how can we widen our
    horizons and begin from scratch with something completely unfamiliar? The
    short answer is: learn what you already know, and how to apply it to a
    different space.
    
    Some of our most vital skills as engineers are those that
    transcend a particular language or tool: debugging superpowers are required
    in all areas of technology, and the ability to coax an unfamiliar toolchain
    to play nicely is absolutely a key skill.
    
    Tips for approaching new tools,
    platforms and communities will give you ideas for how to confidently start
    to pick up some fresh technologies and add new tools to your toolbox.

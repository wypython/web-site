title: "Programming Music for Performance: Live Coding With FoxDot"
date: 2017-11-09
body: |

    This month Ryan Kirkbride will be talking about and demoing FoxDot, a
    library for live coding music:

    FoxDot is a Python library for interactive programming, specifically for
    live coding music. This talk will touch upon the history of live coding,
    the algorave movement (where people get together and dance to algorithms -
    yes, it's true), and how you can use Python to make your own music.
   
    The FoxDot editor gives users the ability to edit their Python code while
    it is being run, allowing them to enter a feedback loop where they can
    execute code, listen to the result, then change the code and re-execute it
    based on what they hear. Often dubbed "the composer programmer", a live
    coder makes the act of composing music a performance practice in itself.
    Python's clean syntax and flexibility lends itself to this and FoxDot
    allows users to define musical algorithms quickly and easily.
    
    The talk will then culminate in a 10 minute improvised performance that
    will demonstrate the wide range of musical capabilities available in the
    system.
    
    FoxDot is maintained at https://github.com/Qirky/FoxDot.

    Date and Time
    =============

    Thursday 9th November, starting around 7.30pm.

    We will finish at about 8:45pm, and will be going to `Headrow House`_
    afterwards.


    Location
    ========

    As usual, we will be meeting at `Futurelabs`_ (`map`_).

    | Futurelabs
    | 1 Eastgate
    | Leeds

    From the Futurelabs web site: "If you’re walking, we’re 50 yards from the
    back entrance of the Victoria Quarter. Simply look left, walk to the
    crossroads and we’re in the building on the opposite corner (above the Gas
    Showrooms). Take the door to the left of the Gas Showrooms and our
    Reception is on the second floor."

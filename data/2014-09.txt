============================================================
 West Yorkshire Python User Group Meeting - Thurs. 12th Sept
============================================================


This week we have a talk from James Westby

Encouraging Contributions To Your Open Source Project
=====================================================

The way you treat first-time contributions to your open source project is very
important if you wish to receive more. Not only will a bad experience put the
submitter off, but the open nature of the project means that potential future
submitters may see the response and decide to put their time in elsewhere.

Learn some of the things that you can do after putting your code on github to
encourage contributions, from documentation to review, and how to help
a submitter bring a patch up to your standards.


James is long-time open source contributer who works in Online Services for Canonical.

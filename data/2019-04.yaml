    About the meeting
    =================

    This month we're meeting at Sky's offices in Leeds Dock. Doors will open at 6:30. The meeting
    will be in Sky 2. Please note this WYPy is on the 3rd Thursday of the month and not the usaul 
    2nd Thursday.

    Code Dojo: StarCraft 2 Bots and AI
    ----------------------------------

    Google's DeepMind has recent demonstrated it can beat pro player at StarCraft 2 (SC2).
    Neural networks are maybe too complicated to start off with but SC2 has an API that can 
    be used to create bots (programs that play a game). In this event we will explore how
    SC2 is controlled from Python and try to write bots.

    There should be no need to set anything up before hand yourself as the plan is to
    use a web environment for the programming and simulation. But if you are interested you 
    could have look at the resources linked from https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto
    and https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2.

    Please come along and have fun!

title: "Simple Selenium Test - A case study"
date: 2014-08-14
body: |
    Simple Selenium Test (SST, http://testutils.org/sst/ ) is an open source Python framework for writing automated tests for web applications.
    SST tests use Selenium Webdriver to drive real web browsers around the system under test.

     * The Test People recently used SST for the first time in a large project for a client.  In this talk I'll cover:
     * How SST compares with other approaches to writing automated functional tests for webapps.
     * Why we thought SST was an appropriate choice for this project
     * What changes we needed to make to the framework to support our needs
     * What changes I'd like to see in the future
     * Whether SST lived up to its promise

    Peter Russell is a Senior Consultant working at The Test People.

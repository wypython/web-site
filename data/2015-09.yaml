    This month Wes Mason, "is going to show us why PHP doesn't suck quite as
    much as we think it does".

    PHP is one of the most popular web development platforms in the world. Like
    it or not you can't argue with the widespread usage and popularity of PHP,
    from CMSs, to forums, eCommerce sites and more, there's a lot of actively
    developed/used code out there.

    Follow along with Wes as he attempts to explain the most appealing
    features, similarities, galloping differences between PHP and Python, and
    why Python developers should care:

    - Similarities (generators, traits, functional, modules).
    - Managing dependencies and distributing packages with Composer.
    - Debugging locally and remotely with XDebug.
    - Pick a framework, really, any framework.
    - Deploying apps with mod_php and php-fpm (We don't need no WSGI here).
    - Documentation, sometimes global everything has good consequences.
    - Migrating between versions, alternative implementations (from HHVM to
      HippyVM) and the future(s) of PHP, 7 and Hack.

title: "Fast Python Implementations: An Opinionated Review"
date: 2016-01-14
body: |

    This month Tony Simpson will be talking about Python interpreter
    performance.

    There have been many attempts to improve on the performance of the CPython
    interpreter but it has proved to be difficult. The talk will examine
    reasons for a faster interpreter. Past and present attempts will be
    examined and compared. The talk will discuss technical details of JITs and
    the CPython interpreter but still be of interest to a general Python
    audience.

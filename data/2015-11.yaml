title: Hypothesis, a QuickCheck style testing library for Python
date: 2015-11-12
body: |

    This month Peter Russell will be talking about Hypothesis.

    Hypothesis is a Python testing library in the spirit of the Haskell and
    OCaml tool QuickCheck.  It is developed by Daved R. MacIver.  It is
    designed to be used alongside a normal unittest tool, but it works like a
    poor man's theorem prover: you write tests for your code that specify
    properties like, “for any valid input, this function should always return a
    non-empty list”, and the tool searches for a way to make the test fail.

    In this talk we´ll be looking at the basics of using Hypothesis to test
    code, including some worked examples.  We may look a little into how it
    works, and hopefully also be looking at how it can be used to implement
    model based testing of more complicated systems.

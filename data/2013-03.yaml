title: Coding Session - Porting Restish to Python 3
date: 2013-03-14
body: |
    This month we have decided to do some good for the world, by porting Matt Goodall's web framework Restish to Python 3.
    Matt is a member of the group, so we'll have all the context we could hope for.

    You can find the source for `Restish here <https://github.com/ish/restish>`_ and the early work on porting it to Python 3 `here <https://github.com/warsaw/restish/tree/py33>`_.

    Don't worry if you're new to Python 3 (a lot of us are), or even to Python, we'll muddle through and figure it out!

    You should probably bring a laptop with Python 2.6 or higher and Python 3.3 installed if you have one available.

    Date and Time
    =============

    Thursday 14 March, from 6:30pm.

    We're starting earlier this month to give us a little more time.
    Don't worry about turning up after the start, it's fully expected that some people will be later.

    Location
    ========

    We will be meeting at the offices of The Test People:

    | Floor 3
    | Albion Court
    | Albion Place
    | Leeds
    | West Yorkshire,
    | LS1 6JL

    You will need to call Peter on 07763570860 for access, as we can't hear the buzzer at the door.

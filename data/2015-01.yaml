    In the first of three meetups focused on Python for micro controller programming Tony will introduce us to the Micropython board, how to get started programming the board, key differences between Micropython and cPython and throw out some ideas for projects based on Micropython.

    Micropython is a great entry point to low level programming for Python programmers.  Micropython has similar hardware to Arduino but is more accessable due to being focused on Python.

    Tony is an experienced Python hacker who loves new and interesting problems

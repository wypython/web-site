title: "PostgreSQL: Beyond the Basics"

    This month, Lorna Mitchell will be talking about `PostgreSQL`_.

    "Most of the applications we build have a relational database behind the
    scenes, but are you making good use of its features?  This session goes
    beyond simple CRUD operations and covers some of PostreSQL's excellent data
    types, complex joins, indexes, and aggregate features we need to work with
    ever-incresing data requirements of the day.  Whether you're a database
    beginner or a seasoned pythonista, there's something here for you."

    If there's enough time and we're very nice to Lorna, she *may* also show
    off some serverless Python apps in a talk called "Fun With Serverless Apps":

    "Serverless and the noOps movement are buzzwords that you've probably
    heard, but could these technologies also solve problems that you actually
    have?  This session will cover *when* to use a serverless approach, and
    answer your questions about how to get started with it.  We'll look at how
    to write code for these platforms, and how to safely and repeatedly deploy
    your code to them.  We'll also look at how we can use these technologies to
    build a skill for the Amazon Echo.  This session is suitable for developers
    of all levels."

    Date and Time
    =============

    Thursday 12th October, starting around 7.30pm.

    We will finish at about 8:45pm, and will be going to `Headrow House`_
    afterwards.

    From the Futurelabs web site: "If you’re walking, we’re 50 yards from the
    back entrance of the Victoria Quarter. Simply look left, walk to the
    crossroads and we’re in the building on the opposite corner (above the Gas
    Showrooms). Take the door to the left of the Gas Showrooms and our
    Reception is on the second floor."

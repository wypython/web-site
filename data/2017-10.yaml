    This month, Lorna Mitchell will be talking about `PostgreSQL`_.

    "Most of the applications we build have a relational database behind the
    scenes, but are you making good use of its features?  This session goes
    beyond simple CRUD operations and covers some of PostreSQL's excellent data
    types, complex joins, indexes, and aggregate features we need to work with
    ever-incresing data requirements of the day.  Whether you're a database
    beginner or a seasoned pythonista, there's something here for you."

    Date and Time
    =============

    Thursday 12th October, starting around 7.30pm.

    We will finish at about 8:45pm, and will be going to `Headrow House`_
    afterwards.


    Location

    As usual, we will be meeting at `Futurelabs`_ (`map`_).

    From the Futurelabs web site: "If you’re walking, we’re 50 yards from the
    back entrance of the Victoria Quarter. Simply look left, walk to the
    crossroads and we’re in the building on the opposite corner (above the Gas
    Showrooms). Take the door to the left of the Gas Showrooms and our
    Reception is on the second floor."

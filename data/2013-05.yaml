    An introductory talk to building fast non-blocking async web services with Tornado, especially relevant to Django, Flask, bottle, web.py, Pyramid, Zope, Gevent, Twisted and every other web (or not) dev interested in learning what makes Tornado special for such tasks.

    This will be especially relevant to Django, Flask, bottle, web.py, Pyramid, Zope, Gevent, Twisted and every other web (or not) dev interested in learning what makes Tornado special for such tasks.

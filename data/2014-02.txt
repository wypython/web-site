 West Yorkshire Python User Group Meeting - Thurs. 13 February
===============================================================

Talk: Teaching Python at The Test People
========================================

In the past two years The Test People have gone from 10% of staff
being able to program Python to over 40% of staff being able to
program Python with more signing up to courses every week. Without
recruiting trained Python programmers,

As Head of Learning at The Test People and Course Leader for all
Python courses I've developed strategies, both big and small, to make
this happen. This talk covers the most effective of those strategies
from Python vs Java for senior stakeholders to how to teach functions
and data structures.


Who's it for?

This session should be suitable for all.  It might be of particular
interest to educators. It will not be code heavy.

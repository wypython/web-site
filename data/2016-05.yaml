    Pair programming game where we attempt to build a small app as a group, but
    two at a time.

    IMPORTANT: we're changing venue to `Future Labs`_ and the week to see how
    it works out. See the *Location* section below for details.

    This month we're doing something a bit different – a pair programming
    game/exercise.

    The basic idea is to attempt to build a small app as a group, but with only
    two people at the computer at a time. All will be explained when you
    arrive! 

    It will be a lot of fun. As well as enlightening, surprising, and
    frustrating. But don't worry, it's nowhere near as scary as it sounds. 

    Anyone is welcome so please come along and join in (or just watch and
    laugh). It doesn't matter if you're just starting out with Python … in
    fact, having a mix of skill levels will make it more interesting.

    By the end of the game, you'll be ready for a beer :).

    Date and Time
    =============

    Thursday 5th May.  Starting at 7.00pm.

    We will finish at around 8.30pm, and will be going to `The White Swan`_ pub
    afterwards.

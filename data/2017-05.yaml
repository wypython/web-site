title: Talisker - One Year On
date: 2017-05-11
body: |

    Talisker is a Python web service runtime environment. It aims to provide
    powerful and standardised ways to run Python WSGI applications. This
    includes providing logging, metrics, error reporting, request tracing,
    tooling, versioning, security, debugging and configuration, in both
    development and in production.

    Talisker was first introduced at WYPy in April last year, and has come
    a long way since then. This talk will introduce Talisker, covering both
    the high level goals and some of the deeper Python specifics.

    From the Futurelabs web site: "If you’re walking, we’re 50 yards from the
    back entrance of the Victoria Quarter. Simply look left, walk to the
    crossroads and we’re in the building on the opposite corner (above the Gas
    Showrooms). Take the door to the left of the Gas Showrooms and our
    Reception is on the second floor."

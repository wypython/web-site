    A common practice these days is for a web application to be split into
    multiple smaller services, divided into discrete responsibilities. It even
    has its own buzzword.

    However, when doing so, your operational complexity increases.  Each
    service needs logging, metrics, error handling, worker management,
    connection pooling, amongst many other things.

    Enter Talisker stage right.

    Talisker is an opinionated WSGI stack designed to standardise operational
    concerns for running many Python services. It is based on gunicorn, and
    provides:

    - structured logging
    - standard status urls
    - request id tracing
    - http connection pools*
    - statsd reporting/client*
    - raven/sentry integration*

    (* WIP)

    It's designed to be developer friendly, and simple to use, as it works as a
    drop in replacement for gunicorn's runner. In was in part inspired by
    Twitter's Finagle tool, and its aim is to provide a more standard PaaS-like
    environment for our services.

title: The Twisted Toolbox

speaker: Simon Davy

    There are many asynchronous networking libraries for Python, but Twisted has been around the longest by far.
    Although it suffers from a mixed reputation (some deserved, some not), it has one killer capability that no other async framework has - it's protocol library.
    Nearly all standard Internet protocols come implemented out-of-the-box on twisted, and when you need it, it's just brilliant.

    We will look at a simple in-memory SMTP *and* IMAP server written to speed up acceptance test runs involving email.
    This will include implementing Twisted SMTP and IMAP interfaces, as well as Twisted.cred, the AUTHN/Z framework.

    This talk will not assume any prior knowledge of Twisted, but will aim to make the case that in this use case, Twisted is hard to beat.

     Talk: Go From a Python Programmer's Perspective
    -------------------------------------------------

    Go is a new language with a long pedigree.
    It was designed at Google by Rob Pike (one of the designers of Unix) and Ken Thomson (one of the designers of C).
    Go seems to be gaining traction as an environment for developing simple, efficient applications.

    Matt Goodall (@atomatt) will be introducing us to Go; showing us some of the key aspects of the language and the runtime's concurrency primitives by building a simple server application.

body: |
    This month we have another exciting guest speaker! Alex Valavanis is a member of the development team of Inkscape; a popular open source vector graphics editor.

    Alex will be telling us about how he became involved with Inkscape, what he does on the project, giving an architectural overview of the software, and throwing in some Python interest by talking about writing extensions.

    We expect the talk to be of interest to all programmers of all skill levels.
    It won't be particularly Python-heavy.

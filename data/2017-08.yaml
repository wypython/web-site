    From the Futurelabs web site: "If you’re walking, we’re 50 yards from the
    back entrance of the Victoria Quarter. Simply look left, walk to the
    crossroads and we’re in the building on the opposite corner (above the Gas
    Showrooms). Take the door to the left of the Gas Showrooms and our
    Reception is on the second floor."

title: Simon Davy, Unit testing Django
date: 2012-12-13
body: |
    Django includes a test framework that is very convenient and widely used.
    It includes test database set up, fixtures, and a convenient way of calling your via Django's framework.

    However, it is actually testing your application at integration level, rather than at *unit* level.
    Integration tests are good, but so are unit tests! (which test smaller areas and run faster).

    In this talk we'll look at three different ways to use standard unit testing techniques when testing django applications to write actual unit tests.

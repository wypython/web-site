    The meetings are always good fun, and everyone of any level of experience or interest in Python is extremely welcome.
    Bring a friend!

    Talks: Python Web Framework Comparrison (Part 1)
    ------------------------------------------------

    This month and next we are comparing Python web frameworks.
    This will comprise a series of short talks.

    Experience Level:
        A basic level of Python knowledge would be helpful.
        Some knowledge of how websites work (HTML, CSS etc.) would also be useful.

    Of Interest to:
       This session will be of particular interest to anyone evaluating web frameworks for future projects, but the techniques used to build them should be interesting for everyone.

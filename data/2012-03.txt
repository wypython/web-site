===========================================================
 West Yorkshire Python User Group Meeting - Thurs. 8 March.
===========================================================

-------------------------
 This Month: Coding Dojo
-------------------------

Instead of our usual talk this month we're going to be holding a
coding dojo.  This is where we work in teams on a small project over
the course of an hour or so.  We will start the evening by collecting
ideas for a task to work on, and voting to choose which to tackle.
We'll end the evening by presenting our results.

If you haven't attended a dojo before you may well be sceptical about
whether this will work, but believe us it does!

Date and Time
=============
Thursday 8 March, from 6:30pm.  Pub afterwards.

Location
========

| Old Broadcasting House
| 148 Woodhouse Lane
| Leeds
| LS2 9EN

We will be holding the dojo in the boardroom at the back of the
ground floor of the building.  If you arrive late we may not hear the
doorbell, so please phone Peter on 07763 570 860.

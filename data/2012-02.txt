=========================================================
 West Yorkshire Python User Group Meeting - Thurs. 8 Feb
=========================================================

About the meeting
=================

We'll be arriving at Old Broadcasting House from about 6:30 onwards
for vaguely Python related chat.  At 7:30 there will be a few short
talks, which are expected to last for about an hour.  After that we
will head to a pub for more geeky chat.

The meetings are always good fun, and everyone of any level of
experience or interest in Python is extremely welcome.  Bring a
friend!

Talks: Python Web Framework Comparrison (Part 2)
------------------------------------------------

This month we are continuing our series of talks comparing Python web
frameworks.

Experience Level:
    A basic level of Python knowledge would be helpful.  Some
    knowledge of how websites work (HTML, CSS etc.) would also be useful.

Of Interest to:
   This session will be of particular interest to anyone evaluating
   web frameworks for future projects, but the techniques used to
   build them should be interesting for everyone.

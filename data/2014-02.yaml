title: Teaching Python at The Test People
date: 2014-02-13
body: |
    In the past two years The Test People have gone from 10% of staff being able to program Python to over 40% of staff being able to program Python with more signing up to courses every week.
    Without recruiting trained Python programmers,

    As Head of Learning at The Test People and Course Leader for all Python courses I've developed strategies, both big and small, to make this happen.
    This talk covers the most effective of those strategies from Python vs Java for senior stakeholders to how to teach functions and data structures.

    Who's it for?

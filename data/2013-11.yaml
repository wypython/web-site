    About the session
    =================

    Geist is a Python library which provides a simple API for writing code which does visual automation of a user interface, this allows you to write programs or tests which interact with visual interfaces in a way similar to a human user.

    TTP has developed Geist to allow them to reduce the time taken to implement functional and performance testing on technologies that are diverse or resistant to UI Object automation approached.

    Things that will be covered:

==========================================================
 West Yorkshire Python User Group Meeting - Thurs. 10 May
==========================================================

----------------------------------------
 Talk: The Twisted Toolbox - Simon Davy
----------------------------------------

There are many asynchronous networking libraries for Python, but
Twisted has been around the longest by far. Although it suffers from a
mixed reputation (some deserved, some not), it has one killer
capability that no other async framework has - it's protocol
library. Nearly all standard Internet protocols come implemented
out-of-the-box on twisted, and when you need it, it's just brilliant.

We will look at a simple in-memory SMTP *and* IMAP server written to
speed up acceptance test runs involving email. This will include
implementing Twisted SMTP and IMAP interfaces, as well as
Twisted.cred, the AUTHN/Z framework.

This talk will not assume any prior knowledge of Twisted, but will aim
to make the case that in this use case, Twisted is hard to beat.

Releasing an Update
===================

1. Write a new reST .txt file for the month.
2. Build the HTML `./build.sh <month.txt>`.
3. Check HTML by either opening templates/index.html in a browser or running
   `python wy.py` and opening http://localhost:5000/.
4. Commit the .txt file and the generated templates/index.html.
5. Push to Heroku's git repo (git@heroku.com:wypy.git).

Don't forget to push to the "official" git repo too.
